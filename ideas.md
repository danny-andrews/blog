* Testing in React
* Biggest things to happen to programming languages: removal of null, inheritance, and throw
* Testing back-to-basics: https://medium.com/p/5bfcceca00ca
* Variable naming
* Use semicolons
* Writing better functions (Avi Grimm)
* Keeping tests DRY
* Alternatives to throwing errors as means of control flow
* JavaScript WTF’s and how to prevent them with ESLint (Subtitle: linting to enforce subset of language)
* Use JSON schema for validating complex user input (including configs)! (ESLint as a case-study)

* Case study: How to implement a responsive grid with inner borders: https://community.spiceworks.com/tools/subnet-calc/
* HOCs and component decorators (usage patterns, definitions, using with class and functional components, how to use with
* PureComponent while preventing stale data due to statically defined closure methods: https://codepen.io/danny-andrews/pen/oGWQov)
* Backwards compat destroys languages: https://esdiscuss.org/topic/having-a-non-enumerable-array-prototype-contains-may-not-be-web-compatible
* Storing error strings in an external file in a sprintf format for later interpolation. This cleans up your code, prevents annoying string breaking, and they can be used in tests, too so you don’t have to do weird RegExp matching
* Do an audit of bugs in OSS and determine the root cause of them (study)
* Languages/frameworks aren't tools. They are building materials. (Finding a better metaphor for software development.)
* Inheritance/composition without classes (case-study: Classless React)
* Crock-Pots - An emerging Object creation pattern
* Elm assessment (including lack of ad-hoc polymorphism)
* Pattern for dealing with effects (layers of dependencies) (testing, dependency injection with the Reader type)
* Separating effects from logic (make into a talk) (https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a#7529)
* No one wants to learn your DSL
* Common patterns and their solutions in CSS (headings, responsive typography, etc.)
* Response to Kent Dodds' "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration."

# My Blog

If you're reading this, congrats, you are probably Danny Andrews! It also probably means you forgot how to build your own site.

## Setup

- `brew install zola`

## Development

- Create a new post by copy and pasting one from the content directory and updating the title and date fields. Hopefully Zola will add a CLI command to automate this.
- Build the assets with `zola build`
- Run the dev server with `zola serve`
- Deploy code with `./deploy.sh`

Check out the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/cli-usage/) docs or just run `zola help`.

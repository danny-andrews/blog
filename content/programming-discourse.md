tl;dr Programmers are emotionally invested in programming language development because they are gonna be stuck writing in it for possibly years to come. Just imagine the net harm JavaScript has done. And don't for a second blame Brendon Eich. Blame big business bastards who couldn't be made to understand that designing a decent language will take more than a week and a half. And guess what else they are to blame for? Naming it something misleading and confusing: JavaScript. Another giant wound from the bludgen of mass-marketing. It has done so much damage. When companies started "betting on JavaScript," I wanted to pull my hair out and scream. But they continue forward with no rhyme or reason. Why the fuck did JavaScript go from being a language in the browser to it being used everywhere.

I never want to write a line of JavaScript again. Ever. I don't care what other language I write in. No, of course I do. I've gotten spoiled with PureScript. Nothing else will suffice.

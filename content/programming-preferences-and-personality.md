I read [this article](https://gist.github.com/ucirello/3cca24504f5f956edefb1f57dd219256) recently. It seeks to understand why some programming divides (ex. dynamic vs static) are so wide. He suggested it was related to their worldview. I see that point, but I'd take it further and say that it is related to your psychological makeup. I would like to see type-discipline preference corelated with certain personality traits. I think you would find static-typers tend to be more reserved. They take pride in solving difficult problems with a high level of certainty and confidence, much higher than the laid-back, outgoing dynamic-typer. If I had to guess, clinical OCD would have a incidence rate within the static-typing camp. Not joking. And I'm not talking about people who like have things orderly. I'm talking about clinically-diagnosed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

I get a sense when we hear people who say things that are factually untrue. Things like, "everyone's a little OCD." I mean everyone is not "a little OCD" in the way everyone is not "a little anemic [WOULD 'DIABETIC' BE BETTER HERE. SINCE ANEMIA IS SORT OF A SLIDING SCALE?]." In the same way some people have plenty of healthy red blood cells to transport oxygen around their body, some people have healthy serotonin levels and a healthy neurology. Those people could also like for thing to be organized and orderly, but they don't have OCD.

I think psychology could give us some clues as to why programming discourse is known for being vitrioloic, but I'll save that for another post.
